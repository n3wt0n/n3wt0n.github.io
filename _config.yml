  This website is always work-in-progress, so it won't be ever ready. :-) 
  <br/>
  It aims to be an open channel for information and connection with the outside world; inside it you will find all of my areas of interest, my hobbies, my passions and some curiosity about my life. 
author_bio: >-
  OK... <i>let me introduce my self. </i>
  <br/><br/>
  My name is <b>Davide Benvegn√π</b>, I was born on July 15th, 1984 in Trieste, a city where I lived for many years. After a "Tuscan moment", having moved to the charming city of Subbiano, now I live and work in Hong Kong.
  <br/><br/>
  I deal mainly in computer science, at various levels. Currently I am <b>DevOps Architect</b> for Microsoft, and I used to be a <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001160?fullName=Davide%20Benvegn%C3%B9" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP in Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management</a> (ALM) for 3 years in a row.
  <br/><br/>
  I'm a staff member of <a href="http://www.dotnettoscana.org/" target="_blank">DotNetToscana</a>, an official Microsoft technical <b>community</b>, where I organize events and have speeches at technical conferences about DevOps, the .Net world, Azure, containers and serverless.
  <br/>
  I'm also the founder of the <a href="http://www.hkmsc.org/" target="_blank">HKMSC - Hong Kong Microsoft Community</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  I have been practicing Mixed Martial Arts (<b>MMA</b>) for some time before moving to Hong Kong, with the Spartan Club Arezzo. Now I train at Impakt, with some of the best fighters in Hong Kong.
  <br/><br/>
  I also like the modern and contemporary art, especially abstract paintings.
